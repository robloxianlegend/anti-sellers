### Risks Discord Sellers Bring to Your Server

1. **Scams and Fraud**

   * Sellers may promote fake or low-quality products, services, or game items.
   * They often take payments but don’t deliver what they promise.
   * This can lead to your members losing money and trust in your community.

2. **Spam and Advertising**

   * Sellers typically spam links, invites, or ads repeatedly.
   * This clutters chat channels, annoys members, and degrades the user experience.
   * Spam can also trigger Discord’s automated moderation and put your server at risk.

3. **Malware and Phishing Links**

   * Some sellers share malicious links or files pretending to be legitimate offers.
   * Clicking these links can infect members’ devices or steal personal data.
   * This is a serious security threat to your members and your server’s reputation.

4. **Toxicity and Scamming Disputes**

   * Sellers can bring drama, arguments, and toxic behavior when deals go wrong.
   * Disputes can cause conflicts among your community members.
   * This damages the friendly, safe atmosphere you want to maintain.

5. **Violation of Discord Terms of Service**

   * Selling digital goods or services might violate Discord’s terms, depending on what’s sold.
   * Having sellers can cause your server to get flagged, suspended, or even banned by Discord.

6. **Illegal or Inappropriate Content**

   * Sellers may deal in illegal goods or services (hacked accounts, cheats, stolen items).
   * This puts your server at risk legally and morally.
   * Hosting such content could bring serious consequences.

7. **Unwanted Bots and Automated Accounts**

   * Sellers sometimes use bots or fake accounts to promote themselves.
   * These bots consume server resources and annoy real members.
   * They often bypass moderation and create more management problems.
